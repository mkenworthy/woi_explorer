# WOI Explorer 

A simple Notebook looking at the properties of the Weird Objects of
Interest (WOI) as identified by Wheeler and Kipping (2019) in their
paper "The Weird Detector".

These are periodic brightenings of a few parts in a thousand with
periods of tens of days.

One hypothesis is that these are the exospheres of hot Jupiters at high
orbital inclination that do not transit the stellar disk, but you are
seeing forward scattering from the planet's atmosphere or particle
scattering from a larger exosphere. Very reminiscent of the cloud model
of Lamers 1997 A&A 328 321, "Beta Pictoris light variations: II.
Scattering by a dust cloud".

The data in the included table was generated by looking for the stellar
parameters from the Kepler archive.
